# Descriptive_Statistics_with_Python
 This project makes a very simple calculation process. It can be useful for Python beginners. You can make modifications if you wish! :)

Example:

ages = [31, 26, 34, 37, 27, 26, 32, 32, 26, 27, 27, 24, 32, 33, 27, 25, 26, 38, 37, 31, 34, 24, 33, 29, 26]

ages = stat(ages)

ages.descriptives()

Output:
'Count: 25, Sum: 744, Max: 38, Min: 24, Range: 14, Mean: 29, Median: 29, Mode: [26], Variance: 18, Standart Deviation: 4.242640687119285'
